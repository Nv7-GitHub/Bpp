# B++
A B++ parser, interpreter, and compiler written in Go! Check [the docs](docs/docs.md) for more information on the B++ language and how it works, and [the programming guide](docs/lib.md) on how to import and use this library, with your code!

## Installation
To install or update B++, do
```bash
go get -u github.com/Nv7-Github/Bpp
```

## Usage
To run a file, do 
```bash
bpp run <filename>
```
For example, to run the `kin` example, do 
```bash
bpp run examples/kin.bpp
```
B++ programs support arguments. To pass arguments, use --args with comma-seperated values. For example:
```bash
bpp run --args arg1,arg2,arg3 <filename>
```
You can time how long it takes to run a B++ program, using --time or -t. For example:
```
bpp run -t <filename>
```

## Converting Go Programs
It can be hard to write B++ code, so you can convert Go code to B++!
Lets say you have a file called `factorial.go`:
```go
package main

func factorial(num int) {
  result := 1
  if num >= 1 {
    result = factorial(num - 1) * num
  }
  return result
}

func main() {
  print(factorial(10))
}
```
Well, you can just do 
```bash
bpp convert factorial.go
```
To convert it to B++ code, saved in the file `factorial.bpp`!

You can also use the `-o` parameter to specify the output file, like:
```bash
bpp convert factorial.go -o coolprogram.bpp
```
To save the B++ code to a file called `coolprogram.bpp`!

## Compiling Programs
Bpp also supports compiling B++ programs into a native, extremely high-performance executable! You can use --time or -t with this too.
> :warning: Arrays are not supported!

To compile a program, just do 
```
bpp build <filename>
```
You can also use -o or --output to specify the output file. For example, to compile the `kin` example, do:
```
bpp build -o kin examples/kin.bpp
```
You can also use --preserve or -p to keep the translated C++!
```
bpp build -p <filename>
```
